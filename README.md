# Aerothon Model 2025 ✈️🧠

A prototype machine learning and computer vision project developed as part of a **national-level hackathon**, focusing on automated defect detection in aeronautical components.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
In aeronautical and industrial environments, manual inspection of components for defects is time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a growing need for automated, camera-based systems that can assist in identifying defects efficiently.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project explores a **computer vision–based approach** to detect visible defects in components using camera input and machine learning concepts. The model is designed as a prototype to demonstrate feasibility rather than a production-ready system.

---

## 🧠 Approach
- Collected and analyzed sample visual data  
- Performed basic preprocessing for model input  
- Experimented with computer vision techniques  
- Designed a pipeline for defect detection using camera input  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Concepts:** Computer Vision, Image Processing, ML fundamentals  

---

## 📊 Results
- Successfully built a working prototype for visual defect detection  
- Demonstrated real-time inspection capability using camera input  
- Identified key limitations and improvement areas during testing  

---

## 🎯 Learnings
- Practical exposure to computer vision workflows
